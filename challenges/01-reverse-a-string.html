  first seperating it. The spliting function will break down the string so that
  It can be read. When spliting the string by adding the followingt ('') tells
  the split funtion to split the string by characters and not by spaces.
  
  Then, by chaining the reverse function, The characters will be reversed.
  Note that it is still seperated at this point, which means it is not a readable 
  string yet.
  
  Finally, they chained the join function, which will combine the characters back into 
  a readable string. Using (""), the join function will know to combine the split
  characters without spaces, otherwise it would look nasty.
