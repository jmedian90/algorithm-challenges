# Overview

This activity is based on FreeCodeCamp's [algorithm challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map-aside#nested-collapseBasicAlgorithmScripting). However, some modifications have been made. Your grade on this activity will be based on your contribution to the exercises. There are 16 exercises, and each exercise will have 3 different ways to contribute.

1. Coding the solution
1. Coding the tests for the solution
1. Adding documentation and comments

Each type of contribution is equally important, and you will need to contribute once for each type of contribution across 3 different exercises. Additionally, a total of 3 people may collaborate on any one form of contribution.

Look through the [open pull requests](https://github.com/cop1000/algorithm-challenges/pulls) and find 3 **different** pull requests you'd like to contribute to. Each of your contributions must be different, and you can work in groups of up to 3 people on a contribution.
