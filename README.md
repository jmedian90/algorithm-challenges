# Overview

This activity is based on FreeCodeCamp's [algorithm challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map-aside#nested-collapseBasicAlgorithmScripting). However, some modifications have been made. Your grade on this activity will be based on your contribution to the exercises. There are 16 exercises, and each exercise will have 3 different ways to contribute.

1. Coding the solution
1. Coding the tests for the solution
1. Adding documentation and comments

Each type of contribution is equally important, and you will need to contribute once for each type of contribution across 3 different exercises. Additionally, a total of 3 people may collaborate on any one form of contribution.

Look through the [open pull requests](https://github.com/cop1000/algorithm-challenges/pulls) and find 3 **different** pull requests you'd like to contribute to. Each of your contributions must be different, and you can work in groups of up to 3 people on a contribution.

### Examples of Acceptable Contributions for Full Credit :white_check_mark:
- I contribute:
  - :one: code to the solution of the `Reverse a String` challenge and there are no other contributors working with me
  - :two: tests to the `Truncate a String` challenge and there are two other contributors working with me, and
  - :three: comments and documentation to the `Chunky Monkey` challenge and there is one other contributor working with me.
- I contribute:
  - :one: code to the solution of the `Falsy Bouncer` challenge and there is one other contributor working with me,
  - :two: tests to the `Title Case a Sentence` challenege and there are no other contributors working with me,
  - :three: documentation and comments to the `Mutations` challenge and there is one other contributor working me.

### Examples of Unacceptable contributions :x:
- I contribute to:
  - :one: code to the solution of `Reverse a String`,
  - :two: tests for the same `Reverse a String` challenge, and
  - :three: documentation and comments to the `Falsy Bouncer` challenge.
  - *Solution: you must contribute to 3 different challenges.*
- I contribute to:
  - :one: code to the solution of `Caesars Cipher` challenge and there are 3 other contributors already working on this.
  - *Solution: each opportunity to contribute can have no more than 3 people, find a different challenge with less contributors.*
- I contribute to:
  - :one: code to the solution,
  - :two: tests, and
  - :three: documentation and comments to the `Seek and Destroy` challenge.
  - *Solution: you must contribute to 3 different challenges.*
